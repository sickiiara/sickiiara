### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Curious, dinamic, positive. I'm creative and I have lots of interests, including writing, reading, painting both on traditional and digital media. I've recently re-discovered one of my teenage-years passion, coding (I used to play around with HTML and CSS when I was in middle school), and I'm now following an intensive 6-months Java back-end development course @Develhope.

ðŸŒ± I have basic Phyton, HTML & CSS skills, which I'm working on in my free time
